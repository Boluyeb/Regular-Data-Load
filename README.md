# Regular-Data-Load
This project focuses on the development of a data pipeline for street level crime data analysis and risk modeling. The goal is to load, clean, transform, and analyze the data, ultimately providing valuable insights to support decision-making in the insurance industry.

In the Jupyter Notebook provided, you will find the complete code implementation and documentation of the project. The code encompasses several essential steps, including data acquisition from the Data.police.uk API, data loading and merging, data cleaning and preprocessing, pivot table creation, and integration with Snowflake for data storage and analysis.

By uploading this project to GitHub, I aim to share the codebase with the community, allowing others to explore, learn, and contribute to the development of similar data pipelines. This project serves as a practical demonstration of handling real-world datasets, implementing data cleaning techniques, working with APIs, and leveraging cloud-based data warehousing.

Feel free to explore the notebook, follow the code, and adapt it to suit your own projects. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated, as we collectively strive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of data analysis pipelines.

Let's delve into the code and unlock the potential of street level crime data for risk modeling and decision-making in the insurance industry.
